# Pokemon Game
## Branches  
**base**: Contains starting game code for "Dodge the Bomb". We build all our new features on top of this project. It helps us understand the basic game idea and how it's put together. Also includes Character class to create pokemons in our game.  
**pikachu**  
**pyree**  
**kkobugi**  
**balls**: Where we work on the "Monster Balls" in our game. This includes things like how the Monster Balls move, look, and what happens when they hit a character.<br>
**runGame**: This branch is where we develop and change the code that makes the game run in pygame. This includes things like the main game loop (which is the code that keeps the game going), how the game responds to things like button clicks or key presses, and how the game updates itself.<br>
