# Pokemon Game
Our project is 'Pokemon game' using Python Pygame library.<br> 
To discribe our game briefly, There are three pokemon in game which has own skill. Player should survive from falling balls by moving selected character.<br>
Our project is based on the open source code named "Dodge the bomb"<br>
Repository setting : Semi-integration manager<br>
Used language : python<br>
## Branches <br>
**base**: Contains starting game code for "Dodge the Bomb". We build all our new features on top of this project. It helps us understand the basic game idea and how it's put together. Also includes Character class to create pokemons in our game.<br>
**pikachu,pyree,kkobugi**: This branch is for developing the selected characters. The branch is responsible for developing and revising features and design elements specific to each character. For instance, Pyree has a skill of eliminating the falling balls. So every skill(method) will be differentiated.<br>
>>>>>>> origin/main
**balls**: Where we work on the "Monster Balls" in our game. This includes things like how the Monster Balls move, look, and what happens when they hit a character.<br>
**runGame**: This branch is where we develop and change the code that makes the game run in pygame. This includes things like the main game loop (which is the code that keeps the game going), how the game responds to things like button clicks or key presses, and how the game updates itself.<br>
