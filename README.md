- Code base : Open source code named "Dodge the bomb"


- Repository setting : Semi-integration manager


- Used language : Python


## Branches <br>
- **base**: Contains starting game code for "Dodge the Bomb". We build all our new features on top of this project. It helps us understand the basic game idea and how it's put together. Also includes Character class to create pokemons in our game.

  
- **pikachu,pyree,kkobugi**: This branch is for developing the selected characters. The branch is responsible for developing and revising features and design elements specific to each character. For instance, Pyree has a skill of eliminating the falling balls. So every skill(method) will be differentiated.


- **balls**: Where we work on the "Monster Balls" in our game. This includes things like how the Monster Balls move, look, and what happens when they hit a character.


- **coin**: This branch is about coins falling down as 'balls' do. Character should collect coins while avoiding the balls. Score will increase as character collects the coins.
